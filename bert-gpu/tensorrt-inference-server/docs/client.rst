Client Libraries and Examples
=============================

The inference server *client libraries* make it easy to communicate
with the TensorRT Inference Server from your C++ or Python
application. Using these libraries you can send either HTTP or GRPC
requests to the server to check status or health and to make inference
requests.

A couple of example applications show how to use the client libraries
to perform image classification and to test performance:

* C++ and Python versions of *image\_client*, an example application
  that uses the C++ or Python client library to execute image
  classification models on the TensorRT Inference Server.

* Python version of *grpc\_image\_client*, an example application that
  is functionally equivalent to *image\_client* but that uses GRPC
  generated client code to communicate with the inference server
  (instead of the client library).

* C++ version of *perf\_client*, an example application that issues a
  large number of concurrent requests to the inference server to
  measure latency and throughput for a given model. You can use this
  to experiment with different model configuration settings for your
  models.

.. _section-getting-the-client-libraries-and-examples:

Getting the Client Libraries and Examples
------------------------------------------

The provided Makefile.client and Dockerfile.client can be used to
build the client libraries and examples. As an alternative to building
it is also possible to download the pre-build client libraries and
examples from GitHub.

.. build-client-begin-marker-do-not-remove

Build Using Dockerfile
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To build the libaries and examples, first change directory to the root
of the repo and checkout the release version of the branch that you
want to build (or the master branch if you want to build the
under-development version). The branch you use for the client build
should match the version of the inference server you are using::

  $ git checkout r19.06

Then, issue the following command to build the C++ client library, C++
and Python examples, and a Python wheel file for the Python client
library::

  $ docker build -t tensorrtserver_client -f Dockerfile.client .

You can optionally add *-\\-build-arg "UBUNTU_VERSION=<ver>"* to set the Ubuntu
version that you want the client library built for. Supported
values for *<ver>* are 16.04 and 18.04, with 16.04 being the default.

After the build completes the tensorrtserver_client docker image will
contain the built client libraries and examples, and will also be
configured with all the dependencies required to run those example
within the container. The easiest way to try the examples described in
the following sections is to run the client image with -\\-net=host so
that the client examples can access the inference server running in
its own container (see :ref:`section-running-the-inference-server` for
more information about running the inference server)::

  $ docker run -it --rm --net=host tensorrtserver_client

In the tensorrtserver_client image you can find the C++ library and
example executables in /workspace/build, and the Python examples in
/workspace/src/clients/python. A tar file containing all the library
and example binaries and Python scripts is at
/workspace/v<version>.clients.tar.gz.

Build Using Makefile
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The actual client build is performed by Makefile.client. The build
dependencies and requirements are shown in Dockerfile.client. To build
without Docker you must first install those dependencies. The Makefile
can also be targeted for other OSes and platforms. We welcome any
updates that expand the Makefiles functionality and allow the clients
to be built on additional platforms.

.. build-client-end-marker-do-not-remove

Download From GitHub
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An alternative to running the examples within the
tensorrtserver_client container is to instead download the pre-built
client libraries and examples from the `GitHub release page
<https://github.com/NVIDIA/tensorrt-inference-server/releases>`_
corresponding to the release you are interested in. The client
libraries and examples are found in the "Assets" section of the
release page in a tar file named after the version of the release, for
example, v1.1.0.clients.tar.gz.

The pre-built libraries and examples can be used on a Ubuntu-16.04
host or you can install them into the TensorRT Inference Server
container to have both the clients and server in the same container::

  $ mkdir clients
  $ cd clients
  $ wget https://github.com/NVIDIA/tensorrt-inference-server/releases/download/<tarfile_path>
  $ tar xzf <tarfile_name>

After untaring you can find the client example binaries in bin/,
libraries in lib/, and Python client examples and wheel file in
python/.

To use the C++ libraries and examples you must install some
dependencies::

  $ apt-get update
  $ apt-get install curl libcurl3-dev

The Python examples require that you additionally install the wheel
file and some other dependencies::

  $ apt-get install python3 python3-pip
  $ pip3 install --user --upgrade python/tensorrtserver-*.whl numpy pillow

The C++ image_client example uses OpenCV for image manipulation so for
that example you must install the following::

  $ apt-get install libopencv-dev libopencv-core-dev

.. _section-image_classification_example:

Image Classification Example Application
----------------------------------------

The image classification example that uses the C++ client API is
available at `src/clients/c++/image\_client.cc
<https://github.com/NVIDIA/tensorrt-inference-server/blob/master/src/clients/c%2B%2B/image_client.cc>`_. The
Python version of the image classification client is available at
`src/clients/python/image\_client.py
<https://github.com/NVIDIA/tensorrt-inference-server/blob/master/src/clients/python/image_client.py>`_.

To use image\_client (or image\_client.py) you must first have a
running inference server that is serving one or more image
classification models. The image\_client application requires that the
model have a single image input and produce a single classification
output. If you don't have a model repository with image classification
models see :ref:`section-example-model-repository` for instructions on
how to create one.

Follow the instructions in :ref:`section-running-the-inference-server`
to launch the server using the model repository. Once the server is
running you can use the image\_client application to send inference
requests to the server. You can specify a single image or a directory
holding images. Here we send a request for the resnet50_netdef model
from the :ref:`example model repository
<section-example-model-repository>` for an image from the `qa/images
<https://github.com/NVIDIA/tensorrt-inference-server/tree/master/qa/images>`_
directory::

  $ image_client -m resnet50_netdef -s INCEPTION qa/images/mug.jpg
  Request 0, batch size 1
  Image '../qa/images/mug.jpg':
      504 (COFFEE MUG) = 0.723991

The Python version of the application accepts the same command-line
arguments::

  $ python3 image_client.py -m resnet50_netdef -s INCEPTION qa/images/mug.jpg
  Request 0, batch size 1
  Image '../qa/images/mug.jpg':
      504 (COFFEE MUG) = 0.778078556061

The image\_client and image\_client.py applications use the inference
server client library to talk to the server. By default image\_client
instructs the client library to use HTTP protocol to talk to the
server, but you can use GRPC protocol by providing the \-i flag. You
must also use the \-u flag to point at the GRPC endpoint on the
inference server::

  $ image_client -i grpc -u localhost:8001 -m resnet50_netdef -s INCEPTION qa/images/mug.jpg
  Request 0, batch size 1
  Image '../qa/images/mug.jpg':
      504 (COFFEE MUG) = 0.723991

By default the client prints the most probable classification for the
image. Use the \-c flag to see more classifications::

  $ image_client -m resnet50_netdef -s INCEPTION -c 3 qa/images/mug.jpg
  Request 0, batch size 1
  Image '../qa/images/mug.jpg':
      504 (COFFEE MUG) = 0.723991
      968 (CUP) = 0.270953
      967 (ESPRESSO) = 0.00115996

The \-b flag allows you to send a batch of images for inferencing.
The image\_client application will form the batch from the image or
images that you specified. If the batch is bigger than the number of
images then image\_client will just repeat the images to fill the
batch::

  $ image_client -m resnet50_netdef -s INCEPTION -c 3 -b 2 qa/images/mug.jpg
  Request 0, batch size 2
  Image '../qa/images/mug.jpg':
      504 (COFFEE MUG) = 0.778078556061
      968 (CUP) = 0.213262036443
      967 (ESPRESSO) = 0.00293014757335
  Image '../qa/images/mug.jpg':
      504 (COFFEE MUG) = 0.778078556061
      968 (CUP) = 0.213262036443
      967 (ESPRESSO) = 0.00293014757335

Provide a directory instead of a single image to perform inferencing
on all images in the directory::

  $ image_client -m resnet50_netdef -s INCEPTION -c 3 -b 2 qa/images
  Request 0, batch size 2
  Image '../qa/images/car.jpg':
      817 (SPORTS CAR) = 0.836187
      511 (CONVERTIBLE) = 0.0708251
      751 (RACER) = 0.0597549
  Image '../qa/images/mug.jpg':
      504 (COFFEE MUG) = 0.723991
      968 (CUP) = 0.270953
      967 (ESPRESSO) = 0.00115996
  Request 1, batch size 2
  Image '../qa/images/vulture.jpeg':
      23 (VULTURE) = 0.992326
      8 (HEN) = 0.00231854
      84 (PEACOCK) = 0.00201471
  Image '../qa/images/car.jpg':
      817 (SPORTS CAR) = 0.836187
      511 (CONVERTIBLE) = 0.0708251
      751 (RACER) = 0.0597549

The grpc\_image\_client.py application at available at
`src/clients/python/grpc\_image\_client.py
<https://github.com/NVIDIA/tensorrt-inference-server/blob/master/src/clients/python/grpc_image_client.py>`_
behaves the same as the image\_client except that instead of using the
inference server client library it uses the GRPC generated client
library to communicate with the server.

.. _section-ensemble_image_classification_example:

Ensemble Image Classification Example Application
-------------------------------------------------

In comparison to the image classification example above, this example uses an
ensemble of a custom image preprocessing model and a Caffe2 ResNet50 model, so
that you can send the image binaries and receive classification results without
preprocessing the images beforehand. The ensemble image classification example
that uses the C++ client API is available at
`src/clients/c++/ensemble\_image\_client.cc
<https://github.com/NVIDIA/tensorrt-inference-server/blob/master/src/clients/c%2B%2B/ensemble_image_client.cc>`_.
The Python version of the image classification client is available at
`src/clients/python/ensemble\_image\_client.py
<https://github.com/NVIDIA/tensorrt-inference-server/blob/master/src/clients/python/ensemble_image_client.py>`_.

To use ensemble\_image\_client (or ensemble\_image\_client.py) you must first
have a running inference server that is serving the
"preprocess_resnet50_ensemble" model and the models it depends on. The models
are provided in example ensemble model repository see
:ref:`section-example-model-repository` for instructions on how to create one.

Follow the instructions in :ref:`section-running-the-inference-server`
to launch the server using the ensemble model repository. Once the server is
running you can use the ensemble\_image\_client application to send inference
requests to the server. You can specify a single image or a directory
holding images. Here we send a request for the ensemble from the
:ref:`example ensemble model repository <section-example-model-repository>` for
an image from the `qa/images
<https://github.com/NVIDIA/tensorrt-inference-server/tree/master/qa/images>`_
directory::

  $ ensemble_image_client qa/images/mug.jpg
  Image 'qa/images/mug.jpg':
      504 (COFFEE MUG) = 0.723991

The Python version of the application accepts the same command-line
arguments::

  $ python3 ensemble_image_client.py qa/images/mug.jpg
  Image 'qa/images/mug.jpg':
      504 (COFFEE MUG) = 0.778078556061

Similar to image\_client, by default ensemble\_image\_client
instructs the client library to use HTTP protocol to talk to the
server, but you can use GRPC protocol by providing the \-i flag. You
must also use the \-u flag to point at the GRPC endpoint on the
inference server::

  $ ensemble_image_client -i grpc -u localhost:8001 qa/images/mug.jpg
  Image 'qa/images/mug.jpg':
      504 (COFFEE MUG) = 0.723991

By default the client prints the most probable classification for the
image. Use the \-c flag to see more classifications::

  $ ensemble_image_client -c 3 qa/images/mug.jpg
  Image 'qa/images/mug.jpg':
      504 (COFFEE MUG) = 0.723991
      968 (CUP) = 0.270953
      967 (ESPRESSO) = 0.00115996

Provide a directory instead of a single image to perform inferencing
on all images in the directory. If the number of images exceeds the maximum
batch size of the ensemble, only the images within the maximum batch size
will be sent::

  $ ensemble_image_client -c 3 qa/images
  Image 'qa/images/car.jpg':
      817 (SPORTS CAR) = 0.836187
      511 (CONVERTIBLE) = 0.0708251
      751 (RACER) = 0.0597549
  Image 'qa/images/mug.jpg':
      504 (COFFEE MUG) = 0.723991
      968 (CUP) = 0.270953
      967 (ESPRESSO) = 0.00115996
  Image 'qa/images/vulture.jpeg':
      23 (VULTURE) = 0.992326
      8 (HEN) = 0.00231854
      84 (PEACOCK) = 0.00201471

Performance Example Application
-------------------------------

The perf\_client example application located at
`src/clients/c++/perf\_client.cc
<https://github.com/NVIDIA/tensorrt-inference-server/blob/master/src/clients/c%2B%2B/perf_client.cc>`_
uses the C++ client API to send concurrent requests to the server to
measure latency and inferences-per-second under varying client loads.

To create each load level the perf\_client maintains a constant number
of outstanding inference requests to the server. The lowest load level
is created by having one outstanding request to the server. When that
request completes (i.e. the response is received from the server), the
perf\_client immediately sends another request. The next highest load
level is created by having two outstanding requests to the server.
When one of those requests completes, the perf\_client immediately
sends another request so that there are always exactly two inference
requests in-flight at all times. The next highest load level is
created with three outstanding requests, etc.

At each load level the perf\_client measures the throughput and
latency over a time window, and then repeats the measurements until it
gets stable results. The perf\_client then increases the load level
and measures again. This repeats until the perf\_client reaches one of
the specified limits: either the maximum latency value is reached or
the maximum concurrency value is reached.

To use perf\_client you must first have a running inference server
that is serving one or more models. The perf\_client application works
with any type of model by sending random data for all input tensors
and by reading and ignoring all output tensors. If you don't have a
model repository see :ref:`section-example-model-repository` for
instructions on how to create one.

Follow the instructions in :ref:`section-running-the-inference-server`
to launch the inference server using the model repository.

The perf\_client application has two major modes. In the first mode
you specify how many concurrent outstanding inference requests you
want and perf\_client finds a stable latency and inferences/second for
that level of concurrency. Use the \-t flag to control concurrency and
\-v to see verbose output. The following example uses four outstanding
inference requests to the inference server::

  $ perf_client -m resnet50_netdef -p3000 -t4 -v
  *** Measurement Settings ***
    Batch size: 1
    Measurement window: 3000 msec

  Request concurrency: 4
    Pass [1] throughput: 207 infer/sec. Avg latency: 19268 usec (std 910 usec)
    Pass [2] throughput: 206 infer/sec. Avg latency: 19362 usec (std 941 usec)
    Pass [3] throughput: 208 infer/sec. Avg latency: 19252 usec (std 841 usec)
    Client:
      Request count: 624
      Throughput: 208 infer/sec
      Avg latency: 19252 usec (standard deviation 841 usec)
      Avg HTTP time: 19224 usec (send 714 usec + response wait 18486 usec + receive 24 usec)
    Server:
      Request count: 749
      Avg request latency: 17886 usec (overhead 55 usec + queue 26 usec + compute 17805 usec)

In the second mode perf\_client will generate an inferences/second
vs. latency curve by increasing request concurrency until a specific
latency limit or concurrency limit is reached. This mode is enabled by
using the \-d option and \-l option to specify the latency limit, and
optionally the \-c option to specify a maximum concurrency limit. By
default the initial concurrency value is one, but the \-t option can
be used to select a different starting value. The following example
measures latency and inferences/second starting with request
concurrency one and increasing until request concurrency equals three
or average request latency exceeds 50 milliseconds::

  $ perf_client -m resnet50_netdef -p3000 -d -l50 -c 3
  *** Measurement Settings ***
    Batch size: 1
    Measurement window: 3000 msec
    Latency limit: 50 msec
    Concurrency limit: 3 concurrent requests

  Request concurrency: 1
    Client:
      Request count: 327
      Throughput: 109 infer/sec
      Avg latency: 9191 usec (standard deviation 822 usec)
      Avg HTTP time: 9188 usec (send/recv 1007 usec + response wait 8181 usec)
    Server:
      Request count: 391
      Avg request latency: 7661 usec (overhead 90 usec + queue 68 usec + compute 7503 usec)

  Request concurrency: 2
    Client:
      Request count: 521
      Throughput: 173 infer/sec
      Avg latency: 11523 usec (standard deviation 616 usec)
      Avg HTTP time: 11448 usec (send/recv 711 usec + response wait 10737 usec)
    Server:
      Request count: 629
      Avg request latency: 10018 usec (overhead 70 usec + queue 41 usec + compute 9907 usec)

  Request concurrency: 3
    Client:
      Request count: 580
      Throughput: 193 infer/sec
      Avg latency: 15518 usec (standard deviation 635 usec)
      Avg HTTP time: 15487 usec (send/recv 779 usec + response wait 14708 usec)
    Server:
      Request count: 697
      Avg request latency: 14083 usec (overhead 59 usec + queue 30 usec + compute 13994 usec)

  Inferences/Second vs. Client Average Batch Latency
  Concurrency: 1, 109 infer/sec, latency 9191 usec
  Concurrency: 2, 173 infer/sec, latency 11523 usec
  Concurrency: 3, 193 infer/sec, latency 15518 usec

Use the \-f option to generate a file containing CSV output of the
results::

  $ perf_client -m resnet50_netdef -p3000 -d -l50 -c 3 -f perf.csv

You can then import the CSV file into a spreadsheet to help visualize
the latency vs inferences/second tradeoff as well as see some
components of the latency. Follow these steps:

- Open `this spreadsheet <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zszgmbSNHHXy0DVEU_4lrL4Md-6dUKwy_mLVmcseUrE>`_
- Make a copy from the File menu "Make a copy..."
- Open the copy
- Select the A2 cell
- From the File menu select "Import..."
- Select "Upload" and upload the file
- Select "Replace data at selected cell" and then select the "Import data" button

.. _section-client-api:

Client API
----------

The C++ client API exposes a class-based interface for querying server
and model status and for performing inference. The commented interface
is available at `src/clients/c++/request.h
<https://github.com/NVIDIA/tensorrt-inference-server/blob/master/src/clients/c%2B%2B/request.h>`_
and in the API Reference.

The Python client API provides similar capabilities as the C++
API. The commented interface is available at
`src/clients/python/\_\_init\_\_.py
<https://github.com/NVIDIA/tensorrt-inference-server/blob/master/src/clients/python/__init__.py>`_
and in the API Reference.

A simple C++ example application at `src/clients/c++/simple\_client.cc
<https://github.com/NVIDIA/tensorrt-inference-server/blob/master/src/clients/c%2B%2B/simple_client.cc>`_
and a Python version at `src/clients/python/simple\_client.py
<https://github.com/NVIDIA/tensorrt-inference-server/blob/master/src/clients/python/simple_client.py>`_
demonstrate basic client API usage.

To run the the C++ version of the simple example, first build or
download it as described in
:ref:`section-getting-the-client-libraries-and-examples` and then::

  $ simple_client
  0 + 1 = 1
  0 - 1 = -1
  1 + 1 = 2
  1 - 1 = 0
  2 + 1 = 3
  2 - 1 = 1
  ...
  14 - 1 = 13
  15 + 1 = 16
  15 - 1 = 14

To run the the Python version of the simple example, first build or
download it as described in
:ref:`section-getting-the-client-libraries-and-examples` and install
the tensorrtserver whl, then::

  $ python3 simple_client.py

String Datatype
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some frameworks support tensors where each element in the tensor is a
string (see :ref:`section-datatypes` for information on supported
datatypes). For the most part, the Client API is identical for string
and non-string tensors. One exception is that in the C++ API a string
input tensor must be initialized with SetFromString() instead of
SetRaw().

String tensors are demonstrated in the C++ example application at
`src/clients/c++/simple\_string\_client.cc
<https://github.com/NVIDIA/tensorrt-inference-server/blob/master/src/clients/c%2B%2B/simple_string_client.cc>`_
and a Python version at `src/clients/python/simple\_string\_client.py
<https://github.com/NVIDIA/tensorrt-inference-server/blob/master/src/clients/python/simple_string_client.py>`_.

.. _section-client-api-stateful-models:

Client API for Stateful Models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When performing inference using a :ref:`stateful model
<section-stateful-models>`, a client must identify which inference
requests belong to the same sequence and also when a sequence starts
and ends.

Each sequence is identified with a correlation ID that is provided
when the inference context is created (in either the Python of C++
APIs). It is up to the clients to create a unique correlation ID. For
each sequence the first inference request should be marked as the
start of the sequence and the last inference requests should be marked
as the end of the sequence. Start and end are marked using the flags
provided with the RunOptions in the C++ API and the run() and
async_run() methods in the Python API.

The use of correlation ID and start and end flags are demonstrated in
the C++ example application at
`src/clients/c++/simple\_sequence\_client.cc
<https://github.com/NVIDIA/tensorrt-inference-server/blob/master/src/clients/c%2B%2B/simple_sequence_client.cc>`_
and a Python version at
`src/clients/python/simple\_sequence\_client.py
<https://github.com/NVIDIA/tensorrt-inference-server/blob/master/src/clients/python/simple_sequence_client.py>`_.
