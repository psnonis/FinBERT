Quickstart
==========

The TensorRT Inference Server is available in two ways:

* As a pre-built Docker container container available from the `NVIDIA
  GPU Cloud (NGC) <https://ngc.nvidia.com>`_. For more information,
  see :ref:`section-using-a-prebuilt-docker-container`.

* As buildable source code located in GitHub. Building the inference
  server yourself requires the usage of Docker and the TensorFlow and
  PyTorch containers available from `NGC <https://ngc.nvidia.com>`_.
  For more information, see :ref:`section-building-from-source-code`.

.. _section-prerequisites:

Prerequisites
-------------

Regardless of which method you choose (starting with a pre-built
container from NGC or building from source), you must perform the
following prerequisite steps:

* Ensure you have access and are logged into NGC.  For step-by-step
  instructions, see the `NGC Getting Started Guide
  <http://docs.nvidia.com/ngc/ngc-getting-started-guide/index.html>`_.

* Install Docker and nvidia-docker.  For DGX users, see `Preparing to
  use NVIDIA Containers
  <http://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/dgx/preparing-containers/index.html>`_.
  For users other than DGX, see the `nvidia-docker installation
  documentation <https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker>`_.

* Clone the TensorRT Inference Server GitHub repo. Even if you choose
  to get the pre-built inference server from NGC, you need the GitHub
  repo for the example model repository and to build the example
  applications. Go to
  https://github.com/NVIDIA/tensorrt-inference-server, select the
  r<xx.yy> release branch that you are using, and then select the
  clone or download drop down button.

* Create a model repository containing one or more models that you
  want the inference server to serve. An example model repository is
  included in the docs/examples/model_repository directory of the
  GitHub repo. Before using the repository, you must fetch any missing
  model definition files from their public model zoos via the provided
  docs/examples/fetch_models.sh script::

  $ cd docs/examples
  $ ./fetch_models.sh

.. _section-using-a-prebuilt-docker-container:

Using A Prebuilt Docker Container
---------------------------------

Make sure you log into NGC as described in
:ref:`section-prerequisites` before attempting the steps in this
section.  Use docker pull to get the TensorRT Inference Server
container from NGC::

  $ docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/tensorrtserver:<xx.yy>-py3

Where <xx.yy> is the version of the inference server that you want to
pull. Once you have the container follow these steps to run the server
and the example client applications.

#. :ref:`Run the inference server <section-run-tensorrt-inference-server>`.
#. :ref:`Verify that the server is running correct <section-verify-inference-server-status>`.
#. :ref:`Get the example client applications <section-getting-the-client-examples>`.
#. :ref:`Run the image classification example <section-running-the-image-classification-example>`.

.. _section-building-from-source-code:

Building From Source Code
-------------------------

Make sure you complete the steps in :ref:`section-prerequisites`
before attempting to build the inference server. To build the
inference server from source, change to the root directory of the
GitHub repo and checkout the release version of the branch that you
want to build (or the master branch if you want to build the
under-development version)::

  $ git checkout r19.06

Then use docker to build::

  $ docker build --pull -t tensorrtserver

After the build completes follow these steps to run the server and the
example client applications.

#. :ref:`Run the inference server <section-run-tensorrt-inference-server>`.
#. :ref:`Verify that the server is running correct <section-verify-inference-server-status>`.
#. :ref:`Get the example client applications <section-getting-the-client-examples>`.
#. :ref:`Run the image classification example <section-running-the-image-classification-example>`.

.. _section-run-tensorrt-inference-server:

Run TensorRT Inference Server
-----------------------------

Assuming the example model repository is available in
/full/path/to/example/model/repository, use the following command to
run the inference server container::

  $ nvidia-docker run --rm --shm-size=1g --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864 -p8000:8000 -p8001:8001 -p8002:8002 -v/full/path/to/example/model/repository:/models <docker image> trtserver --model-store=/models

Where <docker image> is *nvcr.io/nvidia/tensorrtserver:<xx.yy>-py3* if
you pulled the inference server container from NGC, or is
*tensorrtserver* if you built the inference server from source.

For more information, see :ref:`section-running-the-inference-server`.

.. _section-verify-inference-server-status:

Verify Inference Server Is Running Correctly
--------------------------------------------

Use the serverâ€™s *Status* endpoint to verify that the server and the
models are ready for inference.  From the host system use curl to
access the HTTP endpoint to request the server status. For example::

  $ curl localhost:8000/api/status
  id: "inference:0"
  version: "0.6.0"
  uptime_ns: 23322988571
  model_status {
    key: "resnet50_netdef"
    value {
      config {
        name: "resnet50_netdef"
        platform: "caffe2_netdef"
      }
      ...
      version_status {
        key: 1
        value {
          ready_state: MODEL_READY
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ready_state: SERVER_READY

The ready_state field should return SERVER_READY to indicate that the
inference server is online, that models are properly loaded, and that
the server is ready to receive inference requests.

For more information, see
:ref:`section-checking-inference-server-status`.

.. _section-getting-the-client-examples:

Getting The Client Examples
---------------------------

The provided Dockerfile.client can be used to build the client
libraries and examples. First change directory to the root of the repo
and checkout the release version of the branch that you want to build
(or the master branch if you want to build the under-development
version). The branch you use for the client build should match the
version of the inference server you are using::

  $ git checkout r19.06

Then use docker to build the C++ client library, C++ and Python
examples, and a Python wheel file for the Python client library::

  $ docker build -t tensorrtserver_client -f Dockerfile.client .

After the build completes, the tensorrtserver_client Docker image
will contain the built client libraries and examples. Run the client
image so that the client examples can access the inference server
running in its own container::

  $ docker run -it --rm --net=host tensorrtserver_client

It is also possible to build the client examples without Docker and
for some platforms per-compiled client examples are available. For
more information, see
:ref:`section-getting-the-client-libraries-and-examples`.

.. _section-running-the-image-classification-example:

Running The Image Classification Example
----------------------------------------

From within the tensorrtserver_client image, run the example
image-client application to perform image classification using the
example resnet50_netdef from the example model repository.

To send a request for the resnet50_netdef (Caffe2) model from the
example model repository for an image from the qa/images directory::

  $ /tmp/client/bin/image_client -m resnet50_netdef -s INCEPTION images/mug.jpg
  Request 0, batch size 1
  Image '../qa/images/mug.jpg':
      504 (COFFEE MUG) = 0.723991

The Python version of the application accepts the same command-line
arguments::

  $ python3 /tmp/client/python/image_client.py -m resnet50_netdef -s INCEPTION images/mug.jpg
  Request 0, batch size 1
  Image '../qa/images/mug.jpg':
      504 (COFFEE MUG) = 0.778078556061

For more information, see :ref:`section-image_classification_example`.
