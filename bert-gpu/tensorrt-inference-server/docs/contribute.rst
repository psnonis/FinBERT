Contributing
============

contribute make a pull request and follow the guidelines outlined in
the `CONTRIBUTING
<https://github.com/NVIDIA/tensorrt-inference-server/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_
document.

Coding Convention
-----------------

Use clang-format to format all source files (\*.h, \*.cc, \*.proto) to
a consistent format. You should run clang-format on all source files
before submitting a pull request::

  $ apt-get install clang-format clang-format-6.0
  $ clang-format-6.0 --style=file -i *.proto *.cc *.h

For convenience there is a format.py script in tools/ that can be used
to clang-format all files within the repo::

  $ cd .../tensorrt-inference-server    # top-level of repo
  $ python format.py *
