       " 'risk weight for other residential mortgage exposures.\\nIn addition, certain off-balance sheet items are assigned credit conversion factors to convert them to asset equivalent amounts to which an appropriate risk weight is applied.\\nFor example, the unused portion of unconditionally cancellable commitments is assigned a 0% conversion factor, while self-liquidating, transaction-related contingent items with an original maturity of one year or less and the amount of a commitment with an initial maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable by the covered banking organization are converted at 20%.\\nTransaction-related contingencies such as bid bonds and standby letters of credit backing nonfinancial obligations, as well as the amount of a commitment with an original maturity of more than one year that is not unconditionally cancellable, have a 50% conversion factor.\\nGeneral guarantees and standby letters of credit backing financial obligations are given a 100% conversion factor.\\nIn addition, pursuant to provisions of the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991, or FDICIA, and related regulations with respect to prompt corrective action, FDIC-insured institutions such as Medallion Bank may only accept brokered deposits without FDIC permission if they meet specified capital standards, and are subject to restrictions with respect to the interest they may pay on deposits unless they are well capitalized.\\nThe U.S.\\nBasel III capital rules revised the capital threshold to be well capitalized.\\nEffective January 1, 2015, in order to qualify as well capitalized, an insured depository institution must maintain a Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5.0%, and the bank must not be under any order or directive from the appropriate regulatory agency to meet and maintain a specific capital level.\\nPursuant to a capital maintenance agreement with the FDIC, we and Medallion Bank have agreed that the capital levels of Medallion Bank will at all times meet or exceed the levels required for Medallion Bank to be considered well-capitalized under the FDIC rules and regulations, that Medallion Bank\\x92s Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio will be maintained at not less than 15%, and that Medallion Bank will maintain an adequate allowance for loan and lease losses.\\nAs of December 31, 2018, Medallion Bank was in compliance with the above rules and tests.\\nMedallion Bank is also subject to certain federal laws that restrict and control its ability to extend credit and provide or receive services between affiliates.\\nSections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W promulgated thereunder limit the transfer of funds by a depository institution to certain of its affiliates, including us, in the form of loans, extensions of credit, investments, or purchases of assets.\\nSections 23A and 23B and Regulation W also require generally that the depository institution\\x92s transactions with its affiliates be on terms no less favorable to Medallion Bank than comparable transactions with unrelated third parties.\\nThe USA Patriot Act and the International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act of 2001,

information sharing procedures governing communications with the government and other financial institutions with respect to suspected terrorists and money laundering activity, and enhancements to suspicious activity reporting, including electronic filing of suspicious activity reports over a secure filing network.\\nThe compliance programs required by the Patriot Act are intended to supplement pre-existing compliance requirements that apply to financial institutions under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, regulations to which Medallion Bank is also subject.\\nThe Bank Secrecy Act requires all financial institutions, including banks, to, among other things, establish a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money

       " 'Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure Our business is heavily concentrated in consumer lending, which carries a high risk of loss and could be adversely affected by an economic downturn.\\nOur business is heavily concentrated in consumer lending.\\nAs a result, we are more susceptible to fluctuations and risks particular to consumer credit than a more diversified company.\\nFor example, our business is particularly sensitive to macroeconomic conditions that affect the U.S.\\neconomy, consumer spending and consumer credit.\\nWe are also more susceptible to the risks of increased regulations and legal and other regulatory actions that are targeted at consumer credit or the specific consumer credit products that we offer (including promotional financing).\\nOur business concentration could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\\nBy its nature, lending to consumers carries with it different risks and typically a higher risk of loss than commercial lending.\\nAlthough the net interest margins are intended to be higher to compensate us for this increased risk, an economic downturn could result in higher loss rates and lower returns than expected, and could affect the profitability of our consumer loan portfolio.\\nDuring periods of economic slowdown, such as the 2007-2009 recession, delinquencies, defaults, repossessions, and losses generally increase, and consumers are likely to reduce their discretionary spending in areas such as recreation and home improvement, which comprise a high proportion of our business.\\nThese periods may also be accompanied by increasing unemployment rates and declining values of consumer products securing outstanding accounts, which weaken collateral coverage and increase the amount of a loss in the event of default.\\nAdditionally, higher gasoline prices, volatile real estate values and market conditions, reset of adjustable rate mortgages to higher interest rates, general availability of consumer credit, or other factors that impact consumer confidence or disposable income could increase loss frequency and decrease consumer demand for RVs, boats, trailers and other consumer products (including in connection with home improvement projects), as well as weaken collateral values on certain types of consumer products.\\nAny decrease in consumer demand for those products could have a material adverse effect on our ability to originate new loans and, accordingly, on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\\nAlthough declines in commodity prices, and more particularly gasoline prices, generally are financially beneficial to the individual consumer, such declines may also have a negative impact on unemployment rates in geographic areas that are highly dependent upon the oil and natural gas industry, which could adversely affect the credit quality of consumers in those areas.\\nOur balance sheet consists of a significant percentage of nonprime consumer loans, which are associated with higher than average delinquency rates.\\nThe actual rates of delinquencies, defaults, repossessions, and losses on these loans could be more dramatically affected by a general economic downturn.\\nIn addition, during an economic slowdown or recession, our servicing costs may increase without a corresponding increase in our net interest income.\\nFurthermore, our business is significantly affected by monetary and regulatory policies of the U.S.\\nFederal Government and its agencies.\\nChanges in any of these policies are influenced by macroeconomic conditions and other factors that are beyond our control and could have a material adverse effect on us through interest rate changes, costs of compliance with increased regulation, and other factors.\\nAlthough market conditions have improved since the 2007-2009 recession, conditions remain challenging for financial institutions.\\nThe process we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure requires complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions and how those economic conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans.\\nThe degree of uncertainty concerning economic conditions may adversely affect the accuracy of our estimates, which may, in turn, impact the reliability of the process and the quality of our assets.\\n18',\n",
       " 'Changes in the taxicab and for-hire vehicle industries have resulted in significantly increased competition and have had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operations.\\nThere have been changes in the taxicab and for-hire vehicle industries that have resulted in significantly increased competition in all of our taxi medallion markets.\\nRidesharing applications, or ridesharing apps, utilized by for-hire vehicles were introduced in New York City in 2011 and continue to expand domestically and globally.\\nMany of these for-hire vehicle operators operate outside of the regulatory regime with which we and our borrowers operate.\\nAs a result, there is an increased risk in competition because such operators are able to pass the cost savings of not having to comply with certain regulations to its passengers.\\nSince 2017, New York State, New York City Council and the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commissions have made several changes to the medallion classes and regulations forcing greater transparency and equal regulation among transportation companies, including; eliminating the distinction between individual and corporate medallions, temporarily capping the number of ride-sharing licenses, minimum-wage regulations for for-hire vehicle (FHV) companies, and congestion pricing.\\nUntil the market fully stabilizes we will not be able to determine the ultimate impact of these changes.\\nAccording to the TLC, between January 2018 and January 2019 approximately 15,500 new for-hire vehicle licenses were issued, increasing the total number of for-hire vehicles to approximately 120,608 as of January 25, 2019, a 14.8% increase from January 2018.\\nIn addition, the New York State legislature enacted a law on December 21, 2011, which was amended on February 17, 2012, to permit cars for-hire to pick up street hails in boroughs outside of Manhattan.\\nPursuant to this law the TLC has issued approximately 8,300 Street Hail Livery licenses since June 2013, of which approximately 3,400 are active.\\nTLC annualized data through November 2018 has shown a 8.9% reduction in total New York City taxicab fares, compared to the annualized data of December 2017, and a 9.1% reduction in the total number of New York City taxicab trips.\\nSuch reductions in fare totals and taxicab trips are likely the result of a combination of ridesharing apps, Street Hail Livery licenses, and other forms of public transportation.\\nAs of December 31, 2018, 8.6% of our medallion loan portfolio was 90 days or more past due.\\nAs discussed in further detail below, there have also been recent decreases in the values of our medallion loan collateral and our Chicago medallions purchased out of foreclosure.\\nIncreased competition from ridesharing apps and Street Hail Livery licenses has reduced our market share, the overall market for taxicab services, the supply of taxicab drivers, income from operating medallions, and the value of taxicab medallions.\\nIf these trends continue and intensify, there would be a further material increase to our loan to value ratios, loan delinquencies, and loan defaults resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\\nDecreases in the value of our medallion loan collateral and our Chicago medallions purchased out of foreclosure have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business.\\nA significant portion of our loan revenue is derived from loans collateralized by New York City taxicab medallions.\\nAccording to TLC data, over the past 20 years New York City taxicab medallions had appreciated in value from under $200,000 to $1,320,000 for corporate medallions and $1,050,000 for individual medallions in 2014.\\nHowever, based on our evaluation of various sale transactions and cash flows of our underlying borrowers performance, we determined that a market value of $186,400, $181,000 net of liquidation costs, was appropriate, reflecting the median transactional activity for the quarter ended December 31, 2018.\\nWe own 159 Chicago taxicab medallions that were purchased out of foreclosure in 2003.\\nAdditionally, a portion of our loan revenue is derived from loans collateralized by Chicago taxicab medallions.\\nThe Chicago medallions had appreciated in value from $50,000 in 2003 to approximately $370,000 in 2013.\\nSince that time, however, there has been a decline in the value of Chicago taxicab medallions to approximately $28,000, $27,160 net of liquidation costs, as of December 31, 2018.\\n19']"
