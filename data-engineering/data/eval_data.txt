[CLS] good [MASK] , everyone . [SEP] welcome to our second quarter 2019 operating and financial results [MASK] . [SEP] participating on the call with me today is our cfo , tom yip . [SEP] first , and foremost , i want to acknowledge our hard-working and [MASK] team , another strong quarter of positive earnings is due to the efforts of everyone at brucejack , in smithers , and here in vancouver . [SEP] on today's [MASK] , i will comment on progress toward increasing our [MASK] rate [MASK] well as the operational highlights for the quarter , and we'll then turn the call [MASK] to tom , who will comment on [MASK] second quarter 2019 financial performance . [SEP]

[CLS] we [MASK] have $415.3 million [MASK] on the $480 million loan facility . [SEP] mill modifications and upgrades required sustained processing at the increased production rate of 3,800 tons per day are progressing on schedule . [SEP] the most [MASK] upgrade was the shift [MASK] the concentrated bagging system to a bulk loading system . [SEP] the [MASK] loading system [MASK] now installed in its permanent location and is operating [MASK] a fully integrated component of the concentrate process . [SEP] modifications to the flotation circuit , [MASK] [MASK] upgraded pumps and piping , [MASK] an additional cleaning cell for the flotation circuit will continue during regularly scheduled [MASK] , as the final components are delivered . [SEP] at the mine , we [MASK] advanced underground development toward [MASK] targeted rate of 1,000 meters per month . [SEP]

[CLS] we expect development to continue at this rate for [MASK] remainder of the year to ensure development remains ahead of production requirements and to maximize access [MASK] stopes . [SEP] we remain on track to achieve [MASK] 2019 production guidance range [MASK] 390,000 to 420,000 ounces of gold . [SEP] as the mine plan continues to progress through a lower grade area [MASK] the valley of the kings , all stopes above the cut off [MASK] of approximately 5 [MASK] per tonne gold are being mined as they become available for production . [SEP] [MASK] a result , gold grade over the first half [MASK] the year was 8.8 grams per tonne and we expect it will average approximately 10.4 grams per [MASK] for 2019 . [SEP]

[CLS] as [MASK] guided , both grade and tonnes are expected to be higher in the second half [MASK] the year as the increased rate of underground development opens the [MASK] and further improves access to reserves . [SEP] all-in sustaining costs [MASK] the first half [MASK] the year was $905 per [MASK] of gold sold , above our annual guidance of $775 to $875 per ounce of gold . [SEP] however , as production increases through the remainder of 2019 , we expect all-in sustaining cost per ounce to be within [MASK] for the year . [SEP] all-in sustaining cost guidance [MASK] approximately $30 million [MASK] sustaining capital , of which approximately $11.6 million was spent [MASK] the first half of the year . [SEP] approximately , $15 million of the estimated [MASK] capital [MASK] allocated for nonrecurring costs . [SEP] finally , i would like to highlight that we continued our track record [MASK] positive cash flows and profitability again this [MASK] as [MASK] have every quarter since achieving commercial production on july 1 , 2017 . [SEP]

[CLS] thank you , [MASK] , and good morning , everybody . [SEP] overall , [MASK] second quarter financial results were quite similar to our first quarter . [SEP] [MASK] generated earnings from mine operations of over $29 million per quarter for a total of $59 million for the first half [MASK] 2019 , [MASK] generated operating cash flows of $41 million per quarter for the total of $81 million [MASK] the first half of this year . [SEP] turning to slide 10 . [SEP] during the [MASK] , we sold 85,953 ounces [MASK] gold at an average [MASK] of $1,252 [MASK] ounce for total revenues [MASK] $130 million compared to 81,434 [MASK] [MASK] gold at an average [MASK] of $1,257 per ounce for total revenues of $103 in [MASK] first quarter of this year . [SEP]

[CLS] the higher cost in the [MASK] quarter reflects higher mine development and resource drilling versus our first quarter . [SEP] our cost of sales , which includes cash production costs , depreciation and deletion , royalties and selling costs [MASK] $970 per ounce sold for [MASK] second quarter versus $908 per ounce in the first quarter . [SEP] included in this quarter's [MASK] [MASK] higher depreciation and depletion charges of approximately $42 per ounce sold due to the updated reserves reported in april . [SEP] the reduction in proven and probable reserves of approximately $1.7 million contained ounces was [MASK] applied to [MASK] calculation of the depreciation and depletion for assets [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] unit of production methods . [SEP] this impact will affect results on a go-forward basis and will be adjusted as the reserves are periodically updated . [SEP]

[CLS] approximately 90 % of the [MASK] and depletion is calculated on the unit of production basis . [SEP] earnings from mining operations were $29.8 million for [MASK] second quarter versus $29.2 million [MASK] the first [MASK] . [SEP] deducting our corporate administrative costs of [MASK] million , we generated operating earnings [MASK] [MASK] quarter of $25.5 million , similar to quarter one . [SEP] there are 2 significant nonoperating items on [MASK] p&l . [SEP] [MASK] first is interest [MASK] of $8.8 million for the [MASK] versus $9.4 million for the first quarter . [SEP] our effective interest rate decreased in 2019 [MASK] 5.8% . [SEP] this [MASK] due to the refinancing completed at the end of 2018 , replacing the project construction debt with syndicated bank debt . [SEP] the second item [MASK] the loss of financial instruments at fair value . [SEP]

[CLS] [MASK] fair value of our offtake obligation is based on future gold prices , interest [MASK] and production profiles . [SEP] that adjustment was a loss of $3.5 million for the quarter versus $7.5 [MASK] for the first quarter . [SEP] this mark-to-market [MASK] has been significant since september [MASK] 2015 and continues to cause volatility in our reported earnings . [SEP] lastly , [MASK] incurred $2.6 million [MASK] [MASK] during the quarter , down from $4.1 million for the first quarter . [SEP] second [MASK] taxes consisted of $1 million [MASK] the [MASK] bc [MASK] taxes and [MASK] [MASK] for deferred taxes . [SEP] [MASK] note , we [MASK] paid bc mineral taxes at a minimum [MASK] of 2% , not the 13% , as we jaw down our significant [MASK] bills [MASK] the next several years , [MASK] well , based on [MASK] updated life of [MASK] and [MASK] gold prices , we do [MASK] anticipate any cash taxes for federal and provincial income taxes until 2023 . [SEP] net earnings for the quarter were $10.4 million or $0.06 per share versus $4.1 million or $0.02 a share in the first quarter . [SEP]

[CLS] we adjust our earnings for items that we believe do [MASK] [MASK] the underlying operations [MASK] the company . [SEP] these are noncash items , consisting of primarily the loss on financial instruments at fair value and deferred income taxes . [SEP] adjusted earnings were $17 [MASK] or $0.09 per share for the quarter versus $16.5 million or $0.09 a share for [MASK] first quarter . [SEP] turning [MASK] slide 16 . [SEP] [MASK] the quarter , we generated $41.2 million of cash flow from operations . [SEP] and as joe mentioned , this extends our record [MASK] [MASK] cash flow for the 8 quarters since start-up in mid 2017 . [SEP] during the quarter , we paid $44.7 million on the debt facility , spent a [MASK] of $7.3 million on capex and $6.9 million on interest . [SEP] we ended the quarter with $34.3 million in cash . [SEP] our syndicated bank debt totaled $480 million at the beginning [MASK] the year . [SEP]

[CLS] as joe has mentioned , with a higher production of sales expected in the second half of [MASK] , we are confirming our guidance [MASK] for the fiscal year . [SEP] basic spending totaled $151 million for the first half [MASK] 2019 , and is tracking our spending guidance for the full year [MASK] $325 million [MASK] $341 million . [SEP] we spent $11 [MASK] on sustaining capital in the [MASK] half of 2019 and [MASK] target a total [MASK] sustaining cap spend of [MASK] million for the year . [SEP] the summer months will allow for [MASK] [MASK] conditions to complete planned projects . [SEP] to sum up , in the second quarter of 2019 , [MASK] financial results [MASK] similar to [MASK] first quarter of the year . [SEP] we continue to focus on underground development and ramping up to [MASK] tonnes [MASK] day . [SEP] for the first half of 2019 , we generated operating cash flows of $81 million and reduce our debt by $65 million . [SEP] [MASK] the remainder of 2019 , with higher production , we will continue to generate significant [MASK] to enable debt [MASK] ahead of schedule . [SEP]

[CLS] [MASK] also expect [MASK] reduce development cost , as we will [MASK] developing an [MASK] as opposed to waste . [SEP] we are , however , still in the testing [MASK] . [SEP] once we have completed additional test stoping this quarter , we will make a [MASK] on its effectiveness . [SEP] if we do proceed with longitudinal long-haul stoping , it will be incorporated into our annual [MASK] update and require an updated [MASK] [MASK] mine plan , which we would expect to complete in [MASK] first quarter of next year . [SEP] resource [MASK] and expansion drilling is expected to improve reserve definition ahead of [MASK] , and to expand the current mineral resource at [MASK] valley of the kings , [MASK] gold [MASK] [MASK] the life of mine . [SEP] turning to slide 24 . [SEP] this is a [MASK] view of the valley of the kings looking to the north . [SEP]

[CLS] opportunities for expansion are located at depth , to the west , to the east and to the northeast of the currently defined mineral resource , we previous drill programs have indicated the continuation of high-grade gold mineralization . [SEP] underground development is under way [MASK] provide access for the third and [MASK] phases of the [MASK] program , which target resource expansion at depth and to the east of the current mineral resource . [SEP] in addition , a surface program is being planned to target expansion of the upper parts of the mineral resource . [SEP] looking back now , on slide 25 , this is a wider section view of the [MASK] property looking to the north , with the valley of the kings [MASK] the [MASK] left corner . [SEP] in the middle of [MASK] slide , 1,000 meters to [MASK] east of the valley of the kings , exploration drilling intersected high-grade gold [MASK] the flow dome zone . [SEP]

[CLS] later in the year , we plan to drive underground roughly [MASK] meters to the east and start [MASK] expansion drilling . [SEP] in addition , [MASK] follow up on last year's deep hole drilling , 2 additional deep holes totaling more than 3,500 meters were drilled in the first half of this year from the eastern edge [MASK] the valley of the [MASK] underground development toward the [MASK] dome zone . [SEP] the deep underground [MASK] drilling confirmed expectations for [MASK] of brucejack style mineralization to [MASK] east of the brucejack mine as well as proximity to porphyry style mineralization at depth . [SEP] of particular [MASK] , hole vu-1787 intersected a zone of mineralized stock [MASK] , including visible gold , extending over 107 meters , approximately 240 meters [MASK] below the eastern limit of the existing valley of the kings mineral resource .
