Running the Server
==================

For best performance the TensorRT Inference Server should be run on a
system that contains Docker, nvidia-docker, CUDA and one or more
supported GPUs, as explained in
:ref:`section-running-the-inference-server`. The inference server can
also be run on non-CUDA, non-GPU systems as described in
:ref:`section-running-the-inference-server-without-gpu`.

.. _section-example-model-repository:

Example Model Repository
------------------------

Before running the TensorRT Inference Server, you must first set up a
model repository containing the models that the server will make
available for inferencing.

An example model repository containing a Caffe2 ResNet50, a TensorFlow
Inception model, an ONNX densenet model, a simple TensorFlow GraphDef model
(used by the :ref:`simple_client example <section-client-api>`),
and a simple TensorFlow GraphDef model using String tensors (used by the
:ref:`simple_string_client example <section-client-api>`) are provided in the
`docs/examples/model_repository
<https://github.com/NVIDIA/tensorrt-inference-server/tree/master/docs/examples/model_repository>`_
directory. Before using the example model repository you must fetch
any missing model definition files from their public model zoos::

  $ cd docs/examples
  $ ./fetch_models.sh

An example ensemble model repository is also provided in the
`docs/examples/ensemble_model_repository
<https://github.com/NVIDIA/tensorrt-inference-server/tree/master/docs/examples/ensemble_model_repository>`_
directory. It contains a custom image preprocess model, Caffe2 ResNet50,
and an ensemble (used by the
:ref:`ensemble_image_client example <section-ensemble_image_classification_example>`).

Before using the example ensemble model repository, in addition to
fetching public model definition files as mentioned above, you must build
the model definition file for the custom image preprocess model
(see :ref:`section-building-the-example-custom-backends` for instructions
on how to build it). Also note that although ensemble models are fully specified
in their model configuration, empty version directories are required for them
to be recognized as valid model directories::

  $ cd docs/examples
  $ mkdir -p ensemble_model_repository/preprocess_resnet50_ensemble/1

.. _section-running-the-inference-server:

Running The Inference Server
----------------------------

Before running the inference server, you must first set up a model
repository containing the models that the server will make available
for inferencing. Section :ref:`section-model-repository` describes how
to create your own model repository. You can also use
:ref:`section-example-model-repository` to set up an example model
repository.

Assuming the sample model repository is available in
/path/to/model/repository, the following command runs the container
you pulled from NGC or built locally::

  $ nvidia-docker run --rm --shm-size=1g --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864 -p8000:8000 -p8001:8001 -p8002:8002 -v/path/to/model/repository:/models <tensorrtserver image name> trtserver --model-store=/models

Where *<tensorrtserver image name>* will be something like
**nvcr.io/nvidia/tensorrtserver:19.06-py3** if you :ref:`pulled the
container from the NGC registry
<section-installing-prebuilt-containers>`, or **tensorrtserver** if
you :ref:`built it from source <section-building-the-server>`.

The nvidia-docker -v option maps /path/to/model/repository on the host
into the container at /models, and the -\\-model-store option to the
server is used to point to /models as the model repository.

The -p flags expose the container ports where the inference server
listens for HTTP requests (port 8000), listens for GRPC requests (port
8001), and reports Prometheus metrics (port 8002).

The -\\-shm-size and -\\-ulimit flags are recommended to improve the
server's performance. For -\\-shm-size the minimum recommended size is
1g but larger sizes may be necessary depending on the number and size
of models being served.

For more information on the Prometheus metrics provided by the
inference server see :ref:`section-metrics`.

.. _section-running-the-inference-server-without-gpu:

Running The Inference Server On A System Without A GPU
------------------------------------------------------

On a system without GPUs, the inference server should be run using
docker instead of nvidia-docker, but is otherwise identical to what is
described in :ref:`section-running-the-inference-server`::

  $ docker run --rm --shm-size=1g --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864 -p8000:8000 -p8001:8001 -p8002:8002 -v/path/to/model/repository:/models <tensorrtserver image name> trtserver --model-store=/models

Because a GPU is not available, the inference server will be unable to
load any model configuration that requires a GPU or that specified a
GPU instance by an :ref:`instance-group <section-instance-groups>`
configuration.

.. _section-checking-inference-server-status:

Checking Inference Server Status
--------------------------------

The simplest way to verify that the inference server is running
correctly is to use the Status API to query the serverâ€™s status. From
the host system use *curl* to access the HTTP endpoint to request
server status. The response is protobuf text showing the status for
the server and for each model being served, for example::

  $ curl localhost:8000/api/status
  id: "inference:0"
  version: "0.6.0"
  uptime_ns: 23322988571
  model_status {
    key: "resnet50_netdef"
    value {
      config {
        name: "resnet50_netdef"
        platform: "caffe2_netdef"
      }
      ...
      version_status {
        key: 1
        value {
          ready_state: MODEL_READY
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ready_state: SERVER_READY

This status shows configuration information as well as indicating that
version 1 of the resnet50_netdef model is MODEL_READY. This means that
the server is ready to accept inferencing requests for version 1 of
that model. A model version ready_state will show up as
MODEL_UNAVAILABLE if the model failed to load for some reason.
