Models And Schedulers
=====================

By incorporating :ref:`multiple frameworks
<section-framework-model-definition>` and also :ref:`custom backends
<section-custom-backends>`, the TensorRT Inference Server supports a
wide variety of models. The inference server also supports multiple
:ref:`scheduling and batching configurations
<section-scheduling-and-batching>` that further expand the class of
models that the inference server can handle.

This section describes *stateless*, *stateful* and *ensemble* models and how the
inference server provides schedulers to support those model types.

.. _section-stateless-models:

Stateless Models
----------------

With respect to the inference server's schedulers, a *stateless* model
(or stateless custom backend) does not maintain state between
inference requests. Each inference performed on a stateless model is
independent of all other inferences using that model.

Examples of stateless models are CNNs such as image classification and
object detection. The :ref:`default scheduler
<section-default-scheduler>` or :ref:`dynamic batcher
<section-dynamic-batcher>` can be used for these stateless models.

RNNs and similar models which do have internal memory can be stateless
as long as the state they maintain does not span inference
requests. For example, an RNN that iterates over all elements in a
batch is considered stateless by the inference server if the internal
state is not carried between inference requests. The :ref:`default
scheduler <section-default-scheduler>` can be used for these stateless
models. The :ref:`dynamic batcher <section-dynamic-batcher>` cannot be
used since the model is typically not expecting the batch to represent
multiple inference requests.

.. _section-stateful-models:

Stateful Models
---------------

With respect to the inference server's schedulers, a *stateful* model
(or stateful custom backend) does maintain state between inference
requests. The model is expecting multiple inference requests that
together form a sequence of inferences that must be routed to the same
model instance so that the state being maintained by the model is
correctly updated. Moreover, the model may require that the inference
server provide *control* signals indicating, for example, sequence
start.

The :ref:`sequence batcher <section-sequence-batcher>` must be used
for these stateful models. As explained below, the sequence batcher
ensures that all inference requests in a sequence get routed to the
same model instance (and batch slot) so that the model can maintain
state correctly. The sequence batcher also communicates with the model
to indicate when a sequence is starting and when a sequence has a
inference request ready for execution.

As explained in :ref:`section-client-api-stateful-models`, when making
inference requests for a stateful model, the client application must
provide the same correlation ID to all requests in a sequence, and
must also mark the start and end of the sequence. The correlation ID
allows the inference server to identify that the requests belong to
the same sequence.

As a running example, assume a TensorRT stateful model that has the
following model configuration::

  name: "stateful_model"
  platform: "tensorrt_plan"
  max_batch_size: 2
  sequence_batching {
    max_sequence_idle_microseconds: 5000000
    control_input [
      {
        name: "START"
        control [
          {
            kind: CONTROL_SEQUENCE_START
            fp32_false_true: [ 0, 1 ]
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        name: "READY"
        control [
          {
            kind: CONTROL_SEQUENCE_READY
            fp32_false_true: [ 0, 1 ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
  input [
    {
      name: "INPUT"
      data_type: TYPE_FP32
      dims: [ 100, 100 ]
    }
  ]
  output [
    {
      name: "OUTPUT"
      data_type: TYPE_FP32
      dims: [ 10 ]
    }
  ]
  instance_group [
    {
      count: 2
    }
  ]

The sequence_batching section indicates that the model should use the
sequence batcher. The instance_group indicates two instances of the
model should be instantiated and max_batch_size indicates that each of
those instances should perform batch-size 2 inferences. The following
figure shows a representation of the sequence batcher and the
inference resources specified by this configuration.

.. image:: images/sequence_example0.png

Each model instance is maintaining state for each batch slot, and is
expecting all inference requests for a given sequence to be routed to
the same slot so that the state is correctly updated. For this example
that means that the inference server can simultaneously perform
inference for up to four sequences.

The sequence batcher:

* Recognizes when an inference request starts a new sequence and
  allocates a slot for that sequence. If no slot is available for the
  new sequence, the server places the inference request in a backlog.

* Recognizes when an inference request is part of a sequence that has
  an allocated slot and routes the request to that slot.

* Recognizes when an inference request is part of a sequence that is
  in the backlog and places the request in the backlog.

* Recognizes when the last inference request in a sequence has been
  completed. The slot occupied by that sequence is immediately
  reallocated to a sequence in the backlog, or freed for a future
  sequence if there is no backlog.

The following figure shows how multiple sequences are scheduled onto
the model instances. On the left the figure shows several sequences of
requests arriving at the inference server. Each sequence could be made
up of any number of inference requests and those individual inference
requests could arrive in any order relative to inference requests in
other sequences, except that the execution order shown on the right
assumes that the first inference request of sequence 0 arrives before
any inference request in sequences 1-5, the first inference request of
sequence 1 arrives before any inference request in sequences 2-5, etc.

The right of the figure shows how the inference request sequences are
scheduled onto the model instances over time.

.. image:: images/sequence_example1.png

For a stateful model to configure the sequence batcher, the model must
accept two input tensors that the inference server uses to communicate
with the model. The control_input section of the sequence batcher
configuration indicates how the model exposes the tensors.

* **Start**: The start input tensor is specified using
  CONTROL_SEQUENCE_START in the configuration. The example
  configuration indicates that the model has an input tensor called
  START with a 32-bit floating point data-type. The inference server
  will define this tensor when executing an inference on the
  model. The tensor provided by the inference server will be
  1-dimensional with size equal to the batch-size. Each element in the
  tensor indicates if the sequence in the corresponding slot is
  starting or not. In the example configuration, fp32_false_true
  indicates that a sequence start is indicated by tensor element equal
  to 1, and non-start is indicated by tensor element equal to 0.

* **Ready**: The ready input tensor is specified using
  CONTROL_SEQUENCE_READY in the configuration. The example
  configuration indicates that the model has an input tensor called
  READY with a 32-bit floating point data-type. The inference server
  will define this tensor when executing an inference on the
  model. The tensor provided by the inference server will be
  1-dimensional with size equal to the batch-size. Each element in the
  tensor indicates if the sequence in the corresponding slot has an
  inference request ready for inference. In the example configuration,
  fp32_false_true indicates that a sequence ready is indicated by
  tensor element equal to 1, and non-start is indicated by tensor
  element equal to 0.

The following figure shows the inference server uses the control input
tensors to communicate with the model. The figure shows two sequences
assigned to the two slots in a model instance. Inference requests for
each sequence arrive over time. The START and READY rows show the
input tensor values used for each execution of the model. Over time
the following happens:

* The first request arrives for the sequence in slot0. Assuming the
  model instance is not already executing an inference, the sequence
  scheduler immediately schedules the model instance to execute
  because an inference request is available.

* This is the first request in the sequence so the corresponding
  element in the START tensor is set to 1. There is no request
  available in slot1 so the READY tensor shows only slot0 as ready.

* After the inference completes the sequence scheduler sees that there
  are no requests available in any slot and so the model instance sits
  idle.

* Next, two inference requests arrive close together in time so that
  the sequence scheduler sees them both available in their respective
  slots. The scheduler immediately schedules the model instance to
  perform a batch-size 2 inference and uses START and READY to show
  that both slots have an inference request avaiable but that only
  slot1 is the start of a new sequence.

* The processing continues in a similar manner for the other inference
  requests.

.. _section-ensemble-models:

Ensemble Models
---------------

An ensemble model represents a *pipeline* of one or more models and the
connection of input and output tensors between those models. Ensemble models are
intended to be used to encapsulate a procedure that involves
multiple models, such as "data preprocessing -> inference -> data postprocessing".
Using ensemble models for this purpose can avoid the overhead of transferring
intermediate tensors and minimize the number of requests that must be sent to
the inference server.

The :ref:`ensemble scheduler <section-ensemble-scheduler>` must be used for
ensemble models, regardless of the scheduler used by the models within the
ensemble. With respect to the ensemble scheduler, an *ensemble* model is not
an actual model. Instead, it specifies the dataflow between models within the
ensemble as :cpp:var:`Step
<nvidia::inferenceserver::ModelEnsembling::Step>`. The
scheduler collects the output tensors in each step, provides them as input
tensors for other steps according to the specification. In spite of that, the
ensemble model is still viewed as a single model from an external view.
:ref:`section-ensemble_image_classification_example` is an example that performs
image classification using an ensemble model.

Note that the ensemble models will inherit the characteristics of the models
involved, so the meta-data in the request header must comply with the models
within the ensemble. For instance, if one of the models is stateful model, then
the inference request for the ensemble model should contain the information
mentioned in the previous :ref:`section <section-stateful-models>`, which will
be provided to the stateful model by the scheduler.

As a running example, consider an ensemble model for image classification and
segmentation that has the following model configuration::

  name: "ensemble_model"
  platform: "ensemble"
  max_batch_size: 1
  input [
    {
      name: "IMAGE"
      data_type: TYPE_STRING
      dims: [ 1 ]
    }
  ]
  output [
    {
      name: "CLASSIFICATION"
      data_type: TYPE_FP32
      dims: [ 1000 ]
    },
    {
      name: "SEGMENTATION"
      data_type: TYPE_FP32
      dims: [ 3, 224, 224 ]
    }
  ]
  ensemble_scheduling {
    step [
      {
        model_name: "image_preprocess_model"
        model_version: -1
        input_map {
          key: "RAW_IMAGE"
          value: "IMAGE"
        }
        output_map {
          key: "PREPROCESSED_OUTPUT"
          value: "preprocessed_image"
        }
      },
      {
        model_name: "classification_model"
        model_version: -1
        input_map {
          key: "FORMATTED_IMAGE"
          value: "preprocessed_image"
        }
        output_map {
          key: "CLASSIFICATION_OUTPUT"
          value: "CLASSIFICATION"
        }
      },
      {
        model_name: "segmentation_model"
        model_version: -1
        input_map {
          key: "FORMATTED_IMAGE"
          value: "preprocessed_image"
        }
        output_map {
          key: "SEGMENTATION_OUTPUT"
          value: "SEGMENTATION"
        }
      }
    ]
  }

The ensemble_scheduling section indicates that the ensemble scheduler will be
used and that the ensemble model consists of three different models. Each element
in step section specifies the model to be used and how the inputs and outputs of
the model are mapped to tensor names recognized by the scheduler. For
example, the first element in step specifies that the latest version of
image_preprocess_model should be used, the content of its input "RAW_IMAGE"
is provided by "IMAGE" tensor, and the content of its output "PREPROCESSED_OUTPUT"
will be mapped to "preprocessed_image" tensor for later use. The tensor names 
recognized by the scheduler are the ensemble inputs, the ensemble outputs and
all values in the input_map and the output_map.

Assuming that only the ensemble model, the preprocess model, the classification
model and the segmentation model are being served, the client applications will
see them as four different models which can process requests independently.
However, the ensemble scheduler will view the ensemble model as the following.

.. image:: images/ensemble_example0.png

When an inference request for the ensemble model is received, the ensemble
scheduler will:

1. Recognize that the "IMAGE" tensor in the request is mapped to input
   "RAW_IMAGE" in the preprocess model.

2. Check models within the ensemble and send an internal request to the
   preprocess model becuase all the input tensors required are ready.

3. Recognize the completion of the internal request, collect the output
   tensor and map the content to "preprocessed_image" which is an unique name
   known within the ensemble.

4. Map the newly collected tensor to inputs of the models within the ensemble.
   In this case, the inputs of "classification_model" and "segmentation_model"
   will be mapped and marked as ready.

5. Check models that require the newly collected tensor and send internal
   requests to models whose inputs are ready, the classification
   model and the segmentation model in this case. Note that the responses will
   be in arbitrary order depending on the load and computation time of
   individual models.

6. Repeat step 3-5 until no more internal requests should be sent, and then
   response to the inference request with the tensors mapped to the ensemble
   output names.
