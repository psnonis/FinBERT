Installing the Server
=====================

The TensorRT Inference Server is available as a pre-built Docker
container or you can :ref:`build it from source
<section-building-the-server>`.

Installing Prebuilt Containers
------------------------------

The inference server is provided as a pre-built container on the
`NVIDIA GPU Cloud (NGC) <https://ngc.nvidia.com>`_.  Before pulling the
container you must have access and be logged into the NGC container
registry as explained in the `NGC Getting Started Guide
<http://docs.nvidia.com/ngc/ngc-getting-started-guide/index.html>`_.

Before you can pull a container from the NGC container registry, you
must have Docker and nvidia-docker installed. For DGX users, this is
explained in `Preparing to use NVIDIA Containers Getting Started Guide
<http://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/dgx/preparing-containers/index.html>`_.
For users other than DGX, follow the `nvidia-docker installation
documentation <https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker>`_ to install
the most recent version of CUDA, Docker, and nvidia-docker.

After performing the above setup, you can pull the TensorRT Inference
Server container using the following command::

  docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/tensorrtserver:19.06-py3

Replace *19.06* with the version of inference server that you want to
pull.
